## 🧠 How It Works  
### 🔥 The Secret Sauce  
#### **JavaScript Magic**  
```javascript  
// Track cursor coordinates  
document.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {  
  move(e);  
});  

// Rocket movement calculation  
const move = (e) => {  
  myDiv.style.left = e.pageX - 50 + "px";  // Center rocket horizontally  
  myDiv.style.top = e.pageY - 50 + "px";   // Center rocket vertically  
};  
```  
*We offset by 50px (half the rocket's 100px size) to keep it centered on the cursor*

#### **CSS Propulsion**  
```css  
#my-div {  
  transition: 0.2s ease-out; /* Smooth motion blur effect */  
  position: absolute;  
}  
```
